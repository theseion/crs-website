# CRS Project Website Repository
[![Build and link check](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains the website for the OWASP CRS Project.

## For users of the CRS

The generated website is automatically updated at https://coreruleset.org/. If you intend to _contribute_ to the website, the rest of this page will guide you through it.

## Requirements

You can edit the documentation on your local system. You will need:
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for installing dependencies. The version we build with is pinned in `.tool-versions`, so [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) will pick it up automatically
- [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) for transpiling to CSS

`npm install` pulls in Hugo _extended_ as the `hugo-extended` package, so the npm scripts below work without a system-wide install. If you prefer your own [Hugo binary](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), it must be the **extended** build.

**Important: You need Hugo _extended_ >= 0.163.0** — the version CI builds with is pinned in `package.json` and `.github/workflows/test.yml`.

There is also a devcontainer (`.devcontainers/devcontainer.json` plus the `Dockerfile`) if you would rather not install anything locally.

## Cloning this repository

Clone this repository to work locally. This way you can edit and verify quickly that everything is working properly before creating a new pull request.

To clone, use the *recursive* option so you will be getting also the theme to render the pages properly:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:coreruleset/website.git
```

We use two subrepos:
- the theme
- the documentation subrepo, which is built with a different theme

If you just want to edit documentation (not the website), you can do it in the [documentation repo](https://github.com/coreruleset/documentation/)

## Editing locally

Install the dependencies once:

```sh
npm install
```

Now you have all in place to perform your local edits.

Everything is created using markdown, and you will normally use the `content` subdirectory to add your edits.

The theme has shortcodes that can be used to simplify editing. You can get more information about it on [Hugo Dot-Org theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/dot-org-hugo-theme/).

Then start the development server — while you edit and save, your changes are refreshed in the browser:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then check your edits on http://localhost:1313/. Drafts and future-dated posts are included, so you can preview a post before its publication date.

Other scripts:

| command | what it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | development server with drafts and future posts |
| `npm run dev:start:with-pagefind` | same, but builds the [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) index first so site search works locally |
| `npm run dev:build` | one-off build, no server |
| `npm run build` | production build (`--gc --minify`), output in `public/` |

The documentation subsite is a separate Hugo site and is not part of these builds. CI builds it with `hugo -s subsite/docs` and merges the output into `public/docs`.

## Online Preview

The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Merges to `main` are deployed to https://coreruleset.org/, and every pull request gets its own preview deployment, linked from the PR.

Pull requests also run the [test workflow](.github/workflows/test.yml), which builds both the main site and the docs subsite and runs a [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) link check over `content/`.

## Authors

Because users are `git` users now (there is no user "logged"), there is a [mapping between authors and github users](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/blob/main/data/authors.yaml). If you want to collaborate, please add your github username as the key, and your data below. See the examples in that file.

## Sending changes for review

Once you are happy with your local changes, please send a PR.
